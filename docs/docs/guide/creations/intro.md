We have put together a simple "creation template" that takes advantage of the PixiJS ecosystem to help you get started with building web-based applications.

This template provides a solid foundation for a variety of applications, including game development. It includes essential features such as screen management, audio, and resize handling. It is designed to streamline your development process and make it easier for you to create engaging web based content. While it is not a full-fledged "game engine", we hope that it will help you get started quickly and build amazing content.

## Overview

The creation template is built on top of PixiJS, as well as other libraries in the PixiJS ecosystem. Lets take a quick look at the technologies used in the template:

- **[PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs)**: A powerful 2D rendering engine that provides a fast and flexible rendering pipeline for creating games and interactive applications.
- **[AssetPack](https://github.com/pixijs/assetpack)**: A library for managing assets in PixiJS applications. It simplifies the creation of assets such as images, sounds, and spritesheets.
- **[PixiJS UI](https://github.com/pixijs/ui)**: A library that contains commonly used UI components, that are extensible to allow them to be used in any project
- **[PixiJS Sound](https://github.com/pixijs/sound)**: A WebAudio API playback library, with filters. Modern audio playback for modern browsers.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast and lightweight build tool that provides instant server start-up. It is used to build and run the project.

We highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with these libraries to get the most out of the creation template

### Additional Libraries

- **[Spine](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes)**: A 2D skeletal animation tool that allows you to create animations for games and other interactive applications. The game template includes support for Spine animations.
- **[motion](https://motion.dev/)**: A simple and powerful tweening library. It allows you to create smooth animations and transitions with minimal code.

## Creation Engine

Included in the template is a simple "creation engine" that provides a set of features to help you build your application. The engine provides features that new users typically struggle with such as screen management, asset loading, audio playback.

You can find more information about the engine in the [Engine Guide](/docs/guide/creations/engine).


## Template Types

We are slowly building up templates to help you build a game for different platforms. Currently, we have the following templates:

- **Web**: A general template for building web-based applications.

**Coming Soon**:
- **[Discord](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk)**: A multiplayer template for building applications that can be run on the Discord platform.
- **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome/developers)**: A template for building applications that can be run on the Facebook instant games platform.
- **[YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/sdk)**: A template for building applications that can be run on the YouTube Playables platform.


You can find the specific documentation for each template in the sidebar.

## More Examples?

If you are looking for more examples, you can check out the [Open Games](https://github.com/pixijs/open-games) repo. It contains a collection of open-source games built with PixiJS that you can use as a reference for your own projects.

These examples use the same tech stack as the game template, however, these where built before this tool was created, so there are some differences to be aware of.
