Welcome to the Game Template documentation!

We have put together a simple game template that takes advantage of the PixiJS ecosystem to help you get started with building web-based games.

This template provides a solid foundation for game development and includes essential features such as screens, audio, and resize handling. It is designed to streamline your game development process and make it easier for you to create engaging games. While it is not a full-fledged game engine, we hope that it will help you get started quickly and build amazing games.

## Overview

The game template is built on top of PixiJS, as well as other libraries in the PixiJS ecosystem. Lets take a quick look at the technologies used in the template:

- **[PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs)**: A powerful 2D rendering engine that provides a fast and flexible rendering pipeline for creating games and interactive applications.
- **[AssetPack](https://github.com/pixijs/assetpack)**: A library for managing assets in PixiJS applications. It simplifies the creation of assets such as images, sounds, and spritesheets.
- **[PixiJS UI](https://github.com/pixijs/ui)**: A library that contains commonly used UI components, that are extensible to allow them to be used in any project
- **[PixiJS Sound](https://github.com/pixijs/sound)**: A WebAudio API playback library, with filters. Modern audio playback for modern browsers.
- **[Game Engine](/docs/guide/games/engine)**: A simple game engine that provides features such as screen management, asset loading, audio playback, and utility functions.

We highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with these libraries to get the most out of the game template

### Additional Libraries

- **[Spine](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes)**: A 2D skeletal animation tool that allows you to create animations for games and other interactive applications. The game template includes support for Spine animations.
- **[motion](https://motion.dev/)**: A simple and powerful tweening library. It allows you to create smooth animations and transitions with minimal code.

## Template Types

We are slowly building up templates to help you build a game for different platforms. Currently, we have the following templates:

- **Web**: A general template for building web-based games.
- **Discord**: A template for building games that can be run on the Discord platform.

**Coming Soon**:
- **Facebook**: A template for building games that can be run on the Facebook platform.
- **YouTube**: A template for building games that can be run on the YouTube platform.

You can find the specific documentation for each template in the sidebar.

## More Examples?

If you are looking for more examples, you can check out the [Open Games](https://github.com/pixijs/open-games) repo. It contains a collection of open-source games built with PixiJS that you can use as a reference for your own projects.

These examples use the same tech stack as the game template, however, these where built before this tool was created, so there are some differences to be aware of.
